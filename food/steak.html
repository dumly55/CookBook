        <section id="description">
            This is a delicious steak that is easy to make and tastes great. It is a great meal for a special occasion or just a nice dinner. 
            We generally want to cut our strips here ranging from at least 1 inch to 1.5 inches at most. This will give you a nice medium rare steak. 
            If you want it more well done, you can cut it thinner.
