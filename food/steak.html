        <p>This is a delicious steak that is easy to make and tastes great. I prefer eating New York Strips because it's leaner than other cuts. It is a great meal for a special occasion or just a nice dinner. We generally want to cut our strips here ranging from at least 1 inch to 1.5 inches at most. This will give you a nice medium rare steak. If you want it more well done, you can cut it thinner.</p>
